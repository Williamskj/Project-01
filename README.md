## Description
In this project our group decided to build an app that allows a user to input a date that they want to fly, where they are flying from, and where they are flying to. We will
then call 2 third-party APIs, a weather API and a flights API, to return some information to the user. We show them the weather at the starting and ending location for the date selected as well as what airlines have flights available between the locations on the chosen date as well as the lowest priced flight. We store the user's previous search criteria and results in local storage so they can see what their last search was and the results that were returned. For styling the group chose top use the 3rd party library "Bulma". JQuery was used to make some javascript code easier.
